<h1>What I do</h1>
<p>
Whether you need a small site for a new business you're starting or a blog, since you recently discovered that you enjoy writing
but would rather have a customized site, it's all good. I use Wordpress mostly for sites that need to get updated often. Mind you
that Wordpress is not only for blogs anymore. It's used as a CMS mostly because it's stable and has a lot of nice plugins
that can be added later whether it's for social media or Ecommerce. Of course there's other solutions but, if your budget is not
too big, it's the best solution in the long run also in terms of hosting which is 6-7 dollars a month.

<h2>"Yeah,but how much?"</h2>
<p>
Some people would rather do it themselves. They think that web design and development must be easy, We live in an era
where books called "Learn how to play piano in 24 hours" are amongst best-sellers. So, they try their hand at it, and
like anything else, unless you invest time into it, it's going to suck. So, if you don't want that to happen you can 
always get a freelancer like me. I'm not a student and I also don't live with my parents so, I'm not going to charge 50$ 
for a site, but you can be sure that when I invest myself in your project, I really care about it, unlike a lot of agencies
that only care about the quantity of sites they build in a week. So, think about it, it's an investment. Why would you pay 
a plumber 150$ to change a small part on your toilet but not me, to build a website that takes a week of work?

<h3>About</h3>
<p>My name is Sebastien Paquet, a web designer from Montreal,
Canada presently living in Nova Scotia, on the East Coast.
I enjoy travelling and working at the same time. I'm a bit 
obsessive when it comes to working on peoples' project. I won't
stop until you're satisfied and everyone is happy. I'm a perfectionist 
that knows when to stop. Well, it wasn't always like that! So, if you
need help for a project, I'm the right person to contact.Don't hesitate.
