I recently started using OSC. I used to think that MIDI was perfect for what I was doing but, looking more
into its possibilities, I wanted to know more. I wanted to find out how to send OSC messages from Renoise to be able
to control Pd. I found an older script in the Renoise tools but It has to be updated. So, this is a goal I'm working
towards. I thought programming Renoise plugins was a potent motivation to learn Lua. The hardest part for me
is to send timestamps. I haven't figured out that part yet. I've been looking into TimelineSA(also used in VVVV), that's
actually pretty simple and efficient, amongst the many OSC sequencers-timeline OSC editors that I discovered while 
looking into the subject.

For this screencast, I got inspired by this site called "Algorithmic Composer", that has great examples on how to code algorithms and apply chaos theory 
principles in Pd. The part 2 of this screencast is going to be based on some of those patches.
